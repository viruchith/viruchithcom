- pnpm

## Content workflow

Articles live under `src/content/blog/` and are validated by the blog collection schema in `src/content.config.ts`.

Each post needs frontmatter like:

```md
---
title: Building Resilient Java APIs
description: What changes when API design is driven by failure modes, latency budgets, and backward compatibility.
publishDate: 2026-04-18
updatedDate: 2026-04-18
category: Architecture
tags:
    - Java
    - APIs
heroImage: ../../assets/blog/building-resilient-java-apis.svg
heroAlt: Abstract illustration of an API gateway and distributed services with telemetry overlays.
featured: false
draft: false
---
```

Hero images should be stored locally in `src/assets/blog/` so Astro can optimize them.

For the full publishing workflow, authoring rules, and recommended patterns, see `BLOG_GUIDE.md`.

## Key routes

- `/` homepage and portfolio sections
- `/articles/` article index (first page, 6 articles per page)
- `/articles/page/[number]/` paginated article listings
- `/articles/search.json` generated fuzzy search index
- `/articles/[slug]/` individual article pages
- `/sitemap.xml` generated sitemap

## SEO and metadata

The shared layout in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` handles:

- title and description metadata
- canonical URLs
- Open Graph and Twitter metadata
- optional JSON-LD structured data
- dark theme color metadata

Article pages add article-specific metadata and schema automatically from markdown frontmatter.
